\section intro Main Page

This file is a short user manual for the \c CNDSM project, a subgradient
method (SM) that solves two Lagrangian dual problems of the Fixed-Charge
Multicommodity Capacitated Network Design (FC-MCND) problem). Two kinds of
relaxations are provided: <em>Flow relaxation</em> (FR) and <em>Knapsack
relaxation</em> (KR). The method has the potentialities and possibilities
to deal with a lot of variants of SM such as the deflected, incremental and
projected one,  because it is implemented according the <em>object
oriented</em> paradigm.
